### üßø Data Science Libraries #

In this repository you'll find simple step-by-step giideline/pipeline using Pycaret3,scikit-learn, pandas, Seaborn.

In Data Science there are tools, packages, and plenty of machine learning library you can choose and explore, below are some of them that we have used so far.

- Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

- Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with ‚Äúrelational‚Äù or ‚Äúlabeled‚Äù data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.

- Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.

- PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially speeds up the experiment cycle and makes you more productive.

- Yellowbrick extends the Scikit-Learn API to make model selection and hyperparameter tuning easier. Under the hood, it‚Äôs using Matplotlib.
